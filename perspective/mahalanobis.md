In 1D Gaussian PDF formula,
on the exponent,
$x-\mu$ is a distance,
scaled by $\sigma$,
then squared.

Squaring gets us smooth-curved symmetry.

In 2D and above,
on the exponent,
analogously we also expect
a scaled and squared distance,
something to do with
the vector $\vec{x}-\vec{\mu}$,
there is no squaring needed,
because vector dot product
is already a squared distance.

Plotted against one variable,
gragh of 1D PDF is a 2D curve,
there is shift by mean,
and scaling by variance.

Plotted against two variables,
graph of 2D PDF is a 3D surface,
apart from shift and scaling,
variables can have correlation between them,
the PDF surface may be rotated,
though its base is always an eclipse.
