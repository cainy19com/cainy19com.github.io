# Gaussian PDF

1D normal pdf is "extremely" memorizable,
if viewed in this manner,
inspired by a Desmos graph.

From quadratic to bell curve.

```meth
x^2 \\[5px]
-x^2 \\[5px]
e^{-x^2}
```

Now we have the similar shape.

Only some shift and scale are needed.

```meth
\displaystyle
p(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\sigma^2\pi}}
e^{\frac{-(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
```

It's still the negative quadratic,
only shifted by mean
and scaled on two places that has $2\sigma^2$,
with one place that has an extra $\pi$.
