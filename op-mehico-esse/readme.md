# Op Mehico Esse

English, math.

Know the language,
for the culture.

Mehico accent helps making it less boring.

I call these "sailing" logs
my little Mehico esse.

Github app, web mobile, and io pages
have varying support for math.

- app can't view math
- mobile layout too narrow for math eq
- pages don't support math and links

Their math lib has grammar diff from Katex.

I write in app with Katex,
and view in pages,
with custom format.
